# Ztor Watch Party

> **Spine.** Written once; every surface file references it. Source of truth for the data contract.
> **Sources:** 2026-06-22 Ztor dev sync-up · 2026-06-22 Ztor IT regular meeting · 2026-06-25 #ztor host-camera architecture thread · prior Watch Party BRD v1 (2026-06-07) · solution architecture diagram.
> **Status:** v3 (adds host camera broadcast to v2). **Date:** 2026-06-26.

> **What v3 adds.** The biz team wants the **host to stream their own camera** alongside the movie (a "watch-along" face-cam). Settled 2026-06-25: it is a **host-only broadcast** carried on a **separate live-media layer** — Ably stays sync/chat/presence only (it never carries video). See the host-camera rows in the data contract, gap engine, and surface specs below.

## Goal
- **Problem** (≤50 words): Ztor wants to launch synced co-watching for the F《我要衝線》 premiere (Aug 4 promo), but there is no way for ops to control **who** may host a watch party or **what** they may stream — and no monitor/analytics for live rooms. Open self-serve hosting would leak licensed content.
- **Solution** (≤50 words): A back office where ops grants specific accounts the right to host, assigns each host a pool of titles/episodes they may stream, sets room capacity, monitors scheduled/live rooms, and reads watch-party order + engagement analytics. Hosts self-serve the room (name/time/price) on the front end.
- **Deliverables:**
  1. **BO** — Watch Party configuration + live monitor + analytics (the prototyped primary surface).
  2. **Frontend** — host creates/controls a room (gated by grant); fans buy a ticket and watch in sync.
  3. Updated solution architecture diagram + this BRD (md + Notion).

## With vs Without
| Time | WITHOUT this feature | WITH this feature |
|---|---|---|
| Aug 4 premiere | Any user could spin up a "watch party" on any title → licensed content (F-series, imported films) leaks; ops can't see or stop a live room | Only Gary's account (ops-granted) can host, only on F《我要衝線》 ep 1–3 (ops-assigned); ops watches occupancy vs the 1,000 cap and can end a room |
| Reporting | Watch-party views invisible to the order count; co-watching value unprovable | Every watch-party ticket counts as an Order; analytics shows attendees, chat activity, avg watch time |

## Core scenario (told ONCE, across surfaces)
- **Given** ops has granted Gary's account the **host** capability and assigned it **F《我要衝線》 ep 1–3** with a room capacity of 1,000,
- **When** Gary (Frontend, host mode) creates a room — names it, sets a start time and a POPCORN ticket price (or free) — shares the link; fans buy a ticket and arrive; at start Gary goes live, picks ep 1 from his assigned pool (and may switch to ep 2 mid-session), and **turns his camera on** so fans see his reactions in a picture-in-picture tile; a fan double-taps Pay; the room fills to cap; Gary briefly disconnects,
- **Then** the system: blocks any non-granted account from hosting; lets Gary stream **only** his granted episodes; carries Gary's **camera as a separate host-only live stream** (not over the Ably sync bus) and signals every viewer to show/hide the PiP tile when he toggles it; charges the double-tapping fan **once**; admits **exactly** up to the cap (extras see "room full"); marks the room `host_away` (paused) while Gary is gone — which also drops the camera — and `live` again on return; writes each ticket as an `Order` counted toward the title; and surfaces all of it in the BO monitor + analytics. No replay after `ended`; refunds use the BO refund button — POPCORN credited back to the buyer in-system (never cash/Stripe), audited.

## Shared data contract

**Shared nouns used** (defined in `_docs/BRD/_shared-contract.md`, referenced not redefined):
- `User`, `Creator`, `Fan`, `Wallet` (POPCORN), `Title`, `Episode`, `Order`, `AuditLog`.

**Feature-specific entities & fields** (exact names + types):
- `HostGrant` { `id`: string, `userId`: string→User.id, `status`: enum, `grantedByOpsId`: string→User.id, `createdAt`: ts, `revokedAt`: ts|null }
- `ContentGrant` { `id`: string, `userId`: string→User.id (the host), `titleId`: string→Title.id, `episodeIds`: string[]→Episode.id, `grantedByOpsId`: string→User.id, `createdAt`: ts }
- `ModeratorGrant` **(6-29)** { `id`: string, `hostId`: string→User.id, `moderatorId`: string→User.id, `grantedByOpsId`: string→User.id, `createdAt`: ts } — extra accounts (besides the host) who may enter the host's rooms to manage chat + kick. Ops-assigned; FE self-serve is a later phase.
- `SiteConfig.siteMaxCapacity` **(6-29)** — **persisted integer**, one site-wide **maximum** room capacity. `WatchParty.capacity ≤ siteMaxCapacity` is enforced at create/edit; a creator can never exceed it.
- `WatchParty` { `id`: string, `hostId`: string→User.id, `name`: string, `titleId`: string→Title.id, `episodeId`: string→Episode.id|null, `status`: enum, `scheduledStartAt`: ts(UTC), `capacity`: integer (host-set, **≤ `siteMaxCapacity`**; 6-28 dropped `advertisedCapacity`), `isPrivate`: boolean, `joinPassword`: string|null (**6-29**; set when `isPrivate`), `ticketPricePopcorn`: integer(≥0), `isFree`: boolean, `ticketsSold`: integer, `hostCameraAllowed`: boolean (default true), `createdAt`: ts }
- `SessionBlacklistEntry` **(6-29)** — **runtime / per-session**, not a site ban. `{ watchPartyId, userId }` — a kicked user cannot rejoin **that session**; the host or a moderator/ops can lift it. A **site-wide** blacklist is a later phase.
- `RoomChatIdentity` **(6-29)** { `id`: string, `watchPartyId`: string→WatchParty.id, `userId`: string→User.id, `chatAlias`: string, `createdAt`: ts } — the **temporary chat name** a fan sets for a room to keep their real identity private. `chatAlias` is **public** (shown to other viewers + in chat/presence); the `userId` link is **ops-only**. **Persisted** so the BO can map an alias back to the real account for moderation / traceability. Per-room (a user may use different aliases in different rooms).
- `WatchPartyTicket` — modelled as an `Order` with `kind = watch_party_ticket`, `refId = WatchParty.id`, `amountPopcorn = WatchParty.ticketPricePopcorn`. No separate entity; reuses shared `Order`.
- `EmailNotification` { `id`: string, `type`: enum, `toUserId`: string→User.id, `watchPartyId`: string→WatchParty.id, `sentAt`: ts }
- `RoomOccupancy` — **runtime only** (Ably presence); not persisted. `occupancy` = live count of present clients.
- `WatchParty.hostCameraAllowed` — **persisted boolean** (default `true`). Ops policy: whether this party's host may turn their camera on at all. Lives on `WatchParty` (added to the entity above); ops-writable, host/fan read-only.
- `HostCameraState` — **runtime only** (signalled over the camera channel + reflected in the BO monitor); not persisted. `{ isLive: boolean, startedAt?: ts }`. The **media bytes never touch Ably** — the camera rides its own real-time media layer (**LiveKit** — WebRTC SFU: host browser publishes → LiveKit fans out → each viewer subscribes in the PiP tile). Ably/the camera channel only carries the **on/off signal**, never the video. (Decided 6-28; LiveKit replaced the earlier IVS/LL-HLS sketch.)

**Enums / allowed values:**
- `HostGrant.status`: `active | revoked`
- `WatchParty.status`: `draft | scheduled | preshow | live | host_away | ended | cancelled`
- `EmailNotification.type`: `party_created | ticket_purchased | party_reminder`
- (`Order.kind` extended with `watch_party_ticket`; `Order.status` `confirmed | refunded` — see shared contract)

**State machine** (`WatchParty.status`):
- `draft` → `scheduled` (host publishes)
- `scheduled` → `preshow` (system, at start − preshow window)
- `preshow` → `live` (host "go live" **AND** server-time confirms) — *"Live" is never the client clock alone*
- `live` → `host_away` (system, on host disconnect)
- `host_away` → `live` (system, on host reconnect)
- `live` → `ended` (host ends **OR** ops ends)
- `host_away` → `ended` (system timeout **OR** ops ends)
- `draft | scheduled | preshow` → `cancelled` (host or ops)
- **Illegal (explicit):** `ended` ✗→ `live`/`preshow`/`scheduled` · `cancelled` ✗→ any · `live` ✗→ `scheduled` · any ✗→ `draft`

**Ownership map** (who WRITES vs READS each field, per surface; *Creator Studio is not involved — host setup is on the Frontend per the 6-22 decision*):
| Field | Frontend (host/fan) | Creator Studio | BO (ops) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HostGrant.*` | read (own) | — | **write** |
| `ContentGrant.*` | read (own) | — | **write** |
| `WatchParty.name / scheduledStartAt / ticketPricePopcorn / isFree` | **write** (host) | — | read |
| `WatchParty.titleId / episodeId` | **write** (host, in-room; restricted to ContentGrant) | — | read |
| `WatchParty.capacity` (single limit) | read | — | **write** (ops default + per-party) |
| `WatchParty.status` | **write** (host: go-live/end) | — | **write** (ops: end/cancel) |
| `WatchParty.hostCameraAllowed` | read | — | **write** (ops policy, default true) |
| `HostCameraState` (isLive) | **write** (host toggles in-room) | — | read (monitor) |
| `WatchParty.ticketsSold` | read | — | read |
| `Order` (watch_party_ticket) | **write** (system on fan purchase) | — | read + **write** `status=refunded` (ops) |
| `EmailNotification.*` | — | — | read (system writes) |
| `AuditLog.*` | — | — | read (system writes on ops action) |

**Shared vocabulary:**
- **Host grant**: the ops-set capability that lets one account create watch parties. Without it, the "host a watch party" action does not appear. Not a user role.
- **Content grant**: the set of titles one host may stream. For a **series** the grant is the specific **episodes**; for a **movie** there are no episodes — the whole title is the unit. The host picks among these **in-room**; they cannot stream anything outside the grant.
- **Capacity**: a **single** hard room limit (default **1,000**) that both displays and gates admission. *(6-28 dev sync dropped the earlier advertised/server dual-number — one value only.)*
- **No replay**: once a room is `ended`, there is no rewind/VOD — the ticket buys the live session only (stated at purchase).
- **Ticket = Order**: a watch-party ticket is an `Order` of kind `watch_party_ticket`; it counts toward the title's total order count.
- **Host camera (watch-along)**: a **host-only** live video of the host's webcam, shown to fans as a **picture-in-picture** tile beside the movie. **Real-time tech decided 2026-06-28 (dev sync): LiveKit** (WebRTC SFU) — dev already stood up a working demo at `stagingdev.ztor.ai/live-demo`. Envelope: **host-only** (viewers never broadcast) · up to **1,000 viewers** per room · **Hong Kong** region. The camera is a **separate live stream carried by LiveKit**, **independent of the movie's host-authoritative play/pause/seek** — toggling the camera or its latency never affects movie sync. **Ably carries only the camera on/off signal**, never the video. *(AWS IVS was judged correct long-term but ~1+ week of env setup, so not pursued for launch; the earlier LL-HLS-on-CDN sketch is superseded — see `outputs/diagrams/watch-party-vendor-options.md` + ADR `decisions/2026-06-28-watch-party-bo-changes.md`.)*

## 2026-06-29 refinements (IT meeting)
Layered on the 6-22/6-25/6-28 spec; source ADR `decisions/2026-06-28-watch-party-bo-changes.md` + the 6-29 IT meeting notes.
- **Capacity is a site-wide ceiling.** `SiteConfig.siteMaxCapacity` (ops-write); `WatchParty.capacity ≤ siteMaxCapacity` enforced at create/edit. *(BO writes the max; FE host sets ≤ it.)*
- **Moderators.** `ModeratorGrant{hostId, moderatorId}` — ops assigns extra accounts who may enter the host's rooms to manage chat + kick (same powers as host, no playback control). FE self-serve = later.
- **Session blacklist.** `SessionBlacklistEntry{watchPartyId,userId}` on kick → no rejoin *that session*; host/mod/ops can lift. Site-wide blacklist = later.
- **Ticket bound to buyer.** A `watch_party_ticket` Order is tied to `userId`; join requires the joiner == the ticket's `userId` (not shareable).
- **Temporary chat name (privacy).** A fan can set a `RoomChatIdentity.chatAlias` for a room — what other viewers see, keeping their real account private. The alias→account link is **stored + ops-only** in the BO so a user can be traced if needed. *(FE = designer's build; BO shows the mapping in party detail.)*
- **Paid-join T&C.** A paid join must record acceptance of a terms checkbox before admission.
- **Private rooms.** `WatchParty.isPrivate` + `joinPassword` — private rooms require the password at the waiting room.
- **Preshow warm-up = 15 min.** Host may enter 15 min before `scheduledStartAt` (within `preshow`).
- **Reminder = 24 h before.** `EmailNotification.type = party_reminder` sends 24 h before start (was "shortly before").
- **Geoblock at entry.** `Title.geoPolicy` enforced on the movie page **and** at the watch-party entry (bypassed-link case).
- **Attendance rate.** BO analytics adds attended ÷ sold (over started parties); deeper reports / revenue tiering land in August.
- **Streaming = LiveKit** (6-28), reflected in `HostCameraState` above.
- **Nice-to-have / later:** co-host (multi-host), per-creator capacity, pinned message, site-wide blacklist, price-approval review, camera recording.
- **Cross-track note:** WP revenue may also surface in the creator **Tastemaker report** (共創收益) — that's the financial-report track, out of scope here (6-28 kept WP revenue in the BO only for July).

| Host turns their camera on/off mid-room; what fans see; the host inappropriate on cam | **Trust&safety / privacy** ‡ | RESOLVED | **host-only** (viewers cannot broadcast); camera is **opt-in** by the host per session (off by default, host toggles in-room); media is a **separate live stream** (**LiveKit**, real-time WebRTC), **not** carried by Ably and **not** persisted/replayed; on `host_away`/`ended` the camera drops; ops can `hostCameraAllowed=false` per party and **End room** kills both movie + cam; viewers see the camera as a labelled **PiP** tile that appears/disappears on the on/off signal | `WatchParty.hostCameraAllowed`, `HostCameraState`, `WatchParty.status` | Frontend + BO | TC-CAM1 |
| Camera feed is out of sync with the movie | Time/latency | RESOLVED | the camera is **independent of the movie's host-authoritative playback** (a parallel **LiveKit** stream, not part of play/pause/seek); LiveKit (WebRTC) is near-real-time, so the host's reactions track the room without affecting movie sync | `HostCameraState` | Frontend | — |
| Which live-media vendor carries the camera | Build/vendor | **RESOLVED (6-28)** | keep **Ably** for sync/chat/presence; the camera rides **LiveKit** (WebRTC SFU) — chosen at the 6-28 dev sync, dev has a working demo at `stagingdev.ztor.ai/live-demo`. AWS IVS (correct long-term, ~1+ wk env setup) and short-term Twitch were not pursued for launch | `HostCameraState` | Backend/infra | Dev — **LiveKit (decided)** |

**Non-‡ refund eligibility policy** (when *is* a refund granted at all) — secondary `NEEDS-POLICY-OWNER`, **Owner: Ops**. Mechanism (manual mark-refunded) is resolved; the *grant criteria* is an ops call. Does not block the prototype.

**P0 — parity:** overview metrics, event list with live/upcoming status, team access (host grant), attendee list, settings/policy, export report.
**P1 — improvements** (each attached to a manifest row): content-pool assignment at **title+episode** granularity · **single capacity limit** · **host_away** monitor state · **views-as-orders** tally · **POPCORN refund + audit**.

## Assumptions
Defaults chosen on "invisible" gaps — a human can override any.
- **Ticket currency = POPCORN integer** (no cents) — matches the app's 🍿 wallet; cleanest for free/paid toggle.
- **1 live party per host at a time** — rate guard default; extra parties may be scheduled.
- **Live chat not persisted** after `ended` — per 6-22 (YouTube-live model).
- **Start-reminder email included** — per the meeting's "時間到要繼續看" note.
- **Single capacity limit** (6-28) — one number that displays and gates; the earlier advertised/server dual-number is dropped.
- **Start time stored UTC, shown viewer-local**; server time drives lifecycle.
- **Refund credits POPCORN back to the buyer in-system** via the BO refund button (6-28) — never cash/Stripe; the action records status + audit.
- **App version (1.0 design) is out of scope for this BRD** — Web-first for Aug 4; App watch party tracked separately.

## Surface map
| Surface | Involved? | Role in this feature |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | **Y** | Host creates/controls a room (grant-gated); fan buys ticket + watches in sync; in-room episode pick; **host toggles their camera → fans see a PiP tile**. |
| Creator Studio | **N** | Not involved — host setup moved to the Frontend (self-serve) per 6-22. No file. |
| BO | **Y** (primary) | Grant hosts, assign content (title+episode), set capacity, **per-party host-camera policy**, monitor live rooms (**incl. camera-live indicator**), analytics, **POPCORN refund**. |
